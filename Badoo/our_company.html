        <br>
        <h4>Badoom was founded 2024.

        <br> It all started in a small home with a thought of sharing old methods that are pure and safe to consume and which will help many to feel better from inside out. We are not only a skincare specialists 
            but our passion is to give you also wellness through nutrition and apply our greatest knowledge to your daily routines. Nowadays there are plenty of cosmetics and foods that are not necessarily good or even 
            safe for humans to use. Plenty or microplastics and carsinogens around.
